Make your script print another line

>On line 8 I added
*puts "Here is another line."*

Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.

>This character comments out a line. If something is commented out it doesn't get used by ruby. It only serves to explain the code.  

Make your script print only one of the lines

>I commented out all of the lines except one with the hash symbol.
