Study Drills:
1)  Add the escape sequences to your Anki deck
2)  Explain the difference between these two in the Readme.md
3)  Add these escape sequences to your ex10.rb file.

1.Memorize all the escape sequences by putting them on flash cards.
2.Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead. Can you see why you might use that instead of """?
> The triple single quote may be useful for blocks of text that have 
string interpolation but you don't want to replace them yet. 

3. Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.
