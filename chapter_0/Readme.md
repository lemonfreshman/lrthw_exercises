Because you went through InstallFest, you can simply review the install steps, but you should already have everything you need to get started.
Since you have a Mac, skip the Windows and Linux sections of this page.
Changes in this chapter:
We will be using Ruby version 2.2.3
We will be using RubyMine instead of TextWrangler/Gedit
We will be using iTerm instead of Terminal
In the section "OS X: What You Should See", the author provides a copy of his Terminal output. You should do the same, but add the output to a Readme.md file in the chapter_0 directory.
Bonus points if you can figure out how to make the Markdown output "look good".
