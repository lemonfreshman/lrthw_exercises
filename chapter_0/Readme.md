Because you went through InstallFest, you can simply review the install steps, but you should already have everything you need to get started.

Since you have a Mac, skip the Windows and Linux sections of this page.

Changes in this chapter:
We will be using Ruby version 2.2.3
We will be using RubyMine instead of TextWrangler/Gedit
We will be using iTerm instead of Terminal

In the section "OS X: What You Should See", the author provides a copy of his Terminal output.  You should do the same, but add the output to a Readme.md file in the chapter_0 directory.

Bonus points if you can figure out how to make the Markdown output "look good".

##Questions:

Provide a link in your Readme.md that links to the documentation for the following classes:

* [Array](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Array.html)
* [Hash](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Hash.htmlHash)
* [Chronic (Rubygem)](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic/)

Find two other relative ruby documentation links online and add those to the Readme.md as well.

* [Enumerable] (http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Enumerable.html)
* [Object](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Object.html)
