What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

>1. Reading and Writing
>2. Attention to Detail
>3. Spotting Differences

Please explain these three skills in your own words.


#Reading and Writing

>Code is like a new language so it's essential to be able to type it out, especially the new symbols that are unique to programming. It's of course essential to be to read it to understand it and use it. 

#Attention to Detail

>Unlike other languages in which small errors are accounted for by the speakers of that language, a small mistake in your code means that the computer most likely will be completely unable to understand it because the language that it uses is so exact. A computer does exactly what you tell it to do so the small details matter, even more so than in other professions.  

# Spotting Differences

>A lot of programming involves looking at different pieces of code that are largely similar but have important small differences.
 Scanning and looking for differences eventually becomes intuitive so it is a skill that is honed. It is important because you may be able to solve problems by noticing the differences and making all the code work together.



#Why do you need to not copy and paste?


>It's important not to copy and paste with these exercises because you want them to become ingrained in your mind and become habitual. You don't want what you are learning to just pass through you, because then what would be the point of learning it? The goal is to retain and use the information. 


#Why is Practice and Persistence important?

>There are often many obstacles to learning a new thing like programming and in the beginning its overwhelming. So with practice you can break down and delve into the subject matter and become a part of it. Persistence is important because many obstacles will come up that will deter you from wanting to go further. 
  If you practice and perist enough to get good habits and overcome the initial hurdles then the whole thing becomes enjoyable and then you will want to do it for it's own sake which makes for a better experience for all.
