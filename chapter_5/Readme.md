Study Drills:

1. Copy ex5.rb to my_ex5.rb and make the requested changes

2. Add a couple of format sequences, don't forget to add comments to explain 
what you're doing


Study Drills:

 1. Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.
 
 2. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Ruby


* Rubocop Errors
> The last line in ex5.rb and my_ex5.rb were both too long so I split them up 
and used "print" for the first half of the line instead of "puts" so that the 
output would be identical.
