This project is exercises 
I did as part of reading
through Learn Ruby the
Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw. 

This work was done as a homework assignment
for the [Davinci Coders] (http://www.davinicoders.com/)
class that I'm taking, titled "Building the Toolbelt of a Junior Ruby on Rails Developer taught by 
[Jason Noble](http://jasonnoble.org).



>Questions:
What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and writing is the ability to read and understand
concepts and the ability to communicate. 
  

Attention to detail involves typing things exactly as you see them and seeing them exactly as they are
  

Spotting differences includes the ability to see similar lines of codes and notice what has been changed or edited. This is important since programmers are often comparing difference versions of code to see why things act differently depending on the details of the code. 


>Why do you need to not copy and paste?

Because you want to build muscle memory and use repetition to understand what it is that you are typing. 
The difficulty helps it stay it your brain. 



>Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Because that is how concepts and skills begin to stick, after many many instances of practice. Persistence is important when you encounter obstactles and causes you to move forward with confidence that you can conquer these problems.
